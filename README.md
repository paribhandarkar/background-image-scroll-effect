# Background Image Scroll Effect

So, I've created this cool background image scroll effect that changes the opacity of the background image as the user scrolls down the page. It's a simple yet engaging visual effect that adds some personality and style to my website or application. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this effect, which allows me to provide my users with a dynamic and interactive experience that helps them engage with my content in new and exciting ways. Overall, it's a great way to make my website or application stand out and create a more immersive experience for my users.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## New Things I Learned

I used the `background-attachment: fixed` and how I can use it to create a "parallax" effect, where the background image appears to move at a different speed than the rest of the content, giving the page a more dynamic and interactive feel.

I also learned about **`window.pageYOffset`** which is a JavaScript property that returns the number of pixels that the document has been scrolled vertically from the top. This property is often used in conjunction with other JavaScript and CSS properties to create scrolling effects and animations on web pages.

## Challenges I faced

When I was creating the scrolling effect with my background image, one of the biggest challenges I faced was setting the initial **`backgroundSize`** and opacity values. I knew that I wanted the background image to change as the user scrolled down the page, but I wasn't sure what values to use to get the effect I was looking for.

At first, I chose some arbitrary values for **`backgroundSize`** and opacity, but the effect wasn't quite what I wanted. I had to spend some time experimenting with different values to find the right combination that would create the effect I had in mind.

This was a bit frustrating, as it required a lot of trial and error. But I eventually found a set of values that worked well and created the scrolling effect I wanted. Once I had the initial values set up, I was able to use JavaScript to adjust the **`backgroundSize`** and opacity as the user scrolled down the page, which gave me the effect I was looking for.

Overall, this experience taught me the importance of choosing meaningful values when working with CSS properties like **`backgroundSize`** and opacity. It also reminded me that sometimes it takes a bit of experimentation to get things just right, and that's okay! With a bit of persistence and creativity, I was able to overcome this challenge and create a scrolling effect that added a lot of visual interest to my web page.
